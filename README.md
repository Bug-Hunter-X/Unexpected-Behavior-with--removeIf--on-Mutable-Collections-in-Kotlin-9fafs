This repository showcases an uncommon, yet potentially problematic, behavior of the `removeIf` function in Kotlin when used with mutable collections (Lists, Maps, Sets).  The `removeIf` function modifies the collection directly. This can lead to unexpected results if the iteration order is not fully understood or if side effects within the predicate lambda are not carefully considered. The example demonstrates this behavior with a List, Map, and Set, highlighting the potential for subtle bugs.
